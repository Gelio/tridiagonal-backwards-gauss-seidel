# Backwards Gauss Seidel
Linear equation system solver for a tridiagonal complex matrix using the Backwards Gauss-Seidel
algorithm.

This script has been created for a college project in Numerical Methods II
(Computer Science at [Warsaw University of Technology](http://www.mini.pw.edu.pl/tikiwiki/)).

All the comments, some variable names are in Polish due to the requirements
of the task. I am sorry for all non-Polish speakers.
If you have any questions
feel free to create an issue or contact me directly.
